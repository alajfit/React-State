# React-State
## Dealing with State in React

* NB: React state by default is null - this.state === null
* State is similar to creating variables outside the render function
    * but this is the proper way to do it
* We must use setState to update a state and render to the DOM
* We update the Virtual DOM and React updates the actual DOM

## Dealing with Props in Reach
* props look very similar to attributes on normal html elements
* props are passed as an object to extended classes
